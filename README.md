# Voting System Simulation
This project implements a voting system simulation with two different voting methods: Ranked Choice Voting and Social Network Voting. It also compares the results of these two methods based on cardinal and ordinal utility.

## Features
- Ranked Choice Voting: A voting method where voters rank candidates in order of preference.
- Social Network Voting: A voting method that takes into account the social connections between voters.
- Utility Comparison: Calculates and compares the cardinal and ordinal utility of the winners from both voting methods.
